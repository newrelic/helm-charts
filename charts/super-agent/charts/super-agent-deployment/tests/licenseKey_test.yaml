suite: licenseKey temporary tests
# These tests are to test that a missing licenseKey actually aborts templating the chart.
# This should be something that the common-library should do, but the common library does
# it while templating the secret with the license to be used as a envVar.
# As the super agent does not support it as a envvar (yet), we added it directly on the
# configuration file. The consequence is that the chart is able to template without
# license.
# TODO: Remove this file when the Super Agent supports licensekey as an envVar.
