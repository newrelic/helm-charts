## Values managed globally

This chart implements the [New Relic's common Helm library](https://github.com/newrelic/helm-charts/tree/master/library/common-library) which
means that it honors a wide range of defaults and globals common to most New Relic Helm charts.

> **Warning**: Note that the flux chart is not maintained by New Relic and thus does not support the `common-library`. Everything under the
`flux2` belongs to the upstream chart and does not honor the [New Relic's common Helm library](https://github.com/newrelic/helm-charts/tree/master/library/common-library).
>
> For a complete list of `values.yaml` of this chart you can refer to the [upstream chart's `values.yaml`](https://github.com/fluxcd-community/helm-charts/blob/flux2-2.10.2/charts/flux2/values.yaml).

Options that can be defined globally include `affinity`, `nodeSelector`, `tolerations`, `proxy` and others. The full list can be found at
[user's guide of the common library](https://github.com/newrelic/helm-charts/blob/master/library/common-library/README.md).

## Chart particularities

> **TODO:** Here is where you should add particularities for this chart like what does the chart do with the privileged and
low data modes or any other quirk that it could have.

As of the creation of the chart, it has no particularities and this section can be removed safely.
