## Example

Make sure you have [added the New Relic chart repository.](../../README.md#installing-charts)

Then, to install this chart, run the following command:

```sh
helm install newrelic/nri-metadata-injection --set cluster=my_cluster_name --generate-name
```

## Resources

The default set of resources assigned to the pods is shown below:

    resources:
      limits:
        memory: 80M
      requests:
        cpu: 100m
        memory: 30M
