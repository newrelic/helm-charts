## Example

Make sure you have [added the New Relic chart repository.](../../README.md#installing-charts)

Then, to install this chart, run the following command:

```sh
helm install newrelic/synthetics-job-manager \
--set synthetics.privateLocationKey=<enter_synthetics_private_location_key> \
```

To install the runtime charts make sure to pass in the `values.yaml` for both synthetics-job-manager and runtime charts. For instance, to install the node-api-runtime the command is as follows:

```sh
helm install [chart-name] charts/synthetics-job-manager/charts/node-api-runtime \
--values charts/synthetics-job-manager/values.yaml \
--values charts/synthetics-job-manager/charts/node-api-runtime/values.yaml \
```
