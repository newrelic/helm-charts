# IMPORTANT #
# ######### #
# When .Values.global.fargate == true, the chart will automatically add the required affinity rules to exclude
# the DaemonSet from Fargate nodes. There is no need to manually touch this property achieve this.
# This automatic exclusion will, however, not take place if this value is overridden: Setting this to a
# non-empty value WHEN deploying in EKS Fargate (global.fargate == true) requires the user to manually
# include in their custom ruleset an exclusion for nodes with "eks.amazonaws.com/compute-type: fargate", as
# the New Relic DaemonSet MUST NOT be deployed on fargate nodes, as the operator takes care of injecting it
# as a sidecar instead.
# Please refer to the daemonset.yaml template for more details on how to achieve this.
