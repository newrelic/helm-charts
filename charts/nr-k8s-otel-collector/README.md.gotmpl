# Helm installation

Download and Update config [here](https://github.com/newrelic/helm-charts/tree/master/charts/nr-k8s-otel-collector/values.yaml#L20-L24) to add a cluster name, and New Relic Ingest - License key

Example: 
```
licenseKey: "EXAMPLEINGESTLICENSEKEY345878592NRALL"
cluster: "SampleApp" 
```

You can install this chart using directly this Helm repository:

```shell
helm repo add newrelic https://helm-charts.newrelic.com
helm upgrade --install newrelic/nr-k8s-otel-collector -f your-custom-values.yaml  -n newrelic --create-namespace
```

{{ template "chart.sourcesSection" . }}

## Confirm installation
### Watch pods spin up:

```
kubectl get pods -n newrelic --watch 
```

### Check logs of opentelemetry pod that spins up: 
```
kubectl logs <otel-pod-name> -n newrelic
```

### Confirm data coming through in New Relic 
You should see data reporting into New Relic within a couple of seconds to the `InfrastructureEvent` table, `Metric` table, and `Log` tables.
```
FROM Metric SELECT * WHERE k8s.cluster.name='<CLUSTER_NAME>'
```
```
FROM InfrastructureEvent SELECT * WHERE k8s.cluster.name='<CLUSTER_NAME>'
```
```
FROM Log SELECT * WHERE k8s.cluster.name='<CLUSTER_NAME>'
```
## Uninstall

Run the following command.

```
helm uninstall nr-k8s-otel-collector -n newrelic
```

## Values managed globally

This chart implements the [New Relic's common Helm library](https://github.com/newrelic/helm-charts/tree/master/library/common-library) which
means that it honors a wide range of defaults and globals common to most New Relic Helm charts.

Options that can be defined globally include `affinity`, `nodeSelector`, `tolerations` and others. The full list can be found at
[user's guide of the common library](https://github.com/newrelic/helm-charts/blob/master/library/common-library/README.md).

## Common Errors

### Exporting Errors

Timeout errors while starting up the collector are expected as the collector attempts to establish a connection with NR. 
These timeout errors can also pop up over time as the collector is running but are transient and expected to self-resolve. Further improvements are underway to mitigate the amount of timeout errors we're seeing from the NR1 endpoint.

```
info	exporterhelper/retry_sender.go:154	Exporting failed. Will retry the request after interval.	{"kind": "exporter", "data_type": "metrics", "name": "otlphttp/newrelic", "error": "failed to make an HTTP request: Post \"https://staging-otlp.nr-data.net/v1/metrics\": context deadline exceeded (Client.Timeout exceeded while awaiting headers)", "interval": "5.445779213s"}
```

### No such file or directory 

Sometimes we see failed to open file errors on the `filelog` and `hostmetrics` receiver because of a race condition where the file or directory no longer exists, as the pod or process was ephemeral (e.g. a cronjob, sleep) and the pod or process was terminated before the collector could read the file. 

`filelog` error: 
```
Failed to open file	{"kind": "receiver", "name": "filelog", "data_type": "logs", "component": "fileconsumer", "error": "open /var/log/pods/<podname>/<containername>/0.log: no such file or directory"}
``` 
`hostmetrics` error:
```

```
