A Helm chart to install New Relic Super agent on Kubernetes

# Helm installation

You can install this chart using directly this Helm repository:

```shell
helm repo add newrelic https://helm-charts.newrelic.com
helm upgrade --install newrelic/super-agent-deployment -f your-custom-values.yaml
```

## Values managed globally

This chart implements the [New Relic's common Helm library](https://github.com/newrelic/helm-charts/tree/master/library/common-library) which
means that it honors a wide range of defaults and globals common to most New Relic Helm charts.

Options that can be defined globally include `affinity`, `nodeSelector`, `tolerations`, `proxy` and others. The full list can be found at
[user's guide of the common library](https://github.com/newrelic/helm-charts/blob/master/library/common-library/README.md).

## Chart particularities

> **TODO:** Here is where you should add particularities for this chart like what does the chart do with the privileged and
low data modes or any other quirk that it could have.

At the point of the creation of the chart, it has no particularities and this section can be removed safely.
