### Customize the Control Plane Endpoints ###
# The New Relic Kubernetest daemonset will attempt to automatically discover the Control Plane endpoints.
#
# See docs for more details and default values:
#  https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/integrations/kubernetes-integration/installation/configure-control-plane-monitoring#discover-nodes-components
#
# If you need to customize the endpoint URLs, enable the following variables and configure based upon your environment.

#

# If you wish to monitor services running on Kubernetes you can provide integrations
# configuration under integrations_config. You just need to create a new entry where
# the "name" is the filename of the configuration file and the data is the content of
# the integration configuration. The name must end in ".yaml" as this will be the
# filename generated and the Infrastructure agent only looks for YAML files. The data
# part is the actual integration configuration as described in the spec here:
# https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/integrations/integrations-sdk/file-specifications/integration-configuration-file-specifications-agent-v180

# For example, if you wanted do to monitor a Redis instance that has a label "app=redis"
# you could do so by adding following entry:
  # integrations_config:
  #   - name: nri-redis.yaml
  #     data:
  #       discovery:
  #         command:
  #           # Run NRI Discovery for Kubernetes
  #           # https://github.com/newrelic/nri-discovery-kubernetes
  #           exec: /var/db/newrelic-infra/nri-discovery-kubernetes
  #           match:
  #             label.app: redis
