Your deployment of the New Relic Infrastructure agent is complete if you have not used --wait during the installation of this helm chart. You can check on the progress of this by running the following command:

    kubectl get daemonset -o wide -w --namespace {{ .Release.Namespace }} {{ template "newrelic.fullname" . }}

{{- if or (not .Values.ksm.enabled) (not .Values.kubelet.enabled) }}

###########
# WARNING #
###########

You have specified ksm or kubelet integration components as not enabled.
Those components are needed to have the full experience on NROne kubernetes explorer.

{{- end }}

{{- if and (include "newrelic.fargate" .) .Values.kubelet.affinity.nodeAffinity }}

###########
# WARNING #
###########

You have specified both an EKS Fargate environment (global.fargate) and custom
nodeAffinity rules, so we couldn't automatically exclude the kubelet daemonSet from
Fargate nodes. In order for the integration to work, you MUST manually exclude
the daemonSet from Fargate nodes.

Please make sure your custom .Values.kubelet.affinity.nodeAffinity achieve the same effect as:

affinity:
  nodeAffinity:
    requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:
      nodeSelectorTerms:
        - matchExpressions:
            - key: eks.amazonaws.com/compute-type
              operator: NotIn
              values:
                - fargate
{{- end }}
