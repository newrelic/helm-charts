Your deployment of the New Relic Infrastructure agent is complete. You can check on the progress of this by running the following command:

    kubectl get daemonset -o wide -w --namespace {{ .Release.Namespace }} {{ template "newrelic.fullname" . }}

{{- if and (include "newrelic.fargate" .) .Values.kubelet.affinity.nodeAffinity }}
###########
# WARNING #
###########

You have specified both an EKS Fargate environment (global.fargate) and custom
nodeAffinity rules, so we couldn't automatically exclude the kubelet daemonSet from
Fargate nodes. In order for the integration to work, you MUST manually exclude
the daemonSet from Fargate nodes.

Please make sure your custom .Values.kubelet.affinity.nodeAffinity achieve the same effect as:

affinity:
  nodeAffinity:
    requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:
      nodeSelectorTerms:
        - matchExpressions:
            - key: eks.amazonaws.com/compute-type
              operator: NotIn
              values:
                - fargate
{{- end }}
