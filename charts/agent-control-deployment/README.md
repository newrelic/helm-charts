# agent-control-deployment

A Helm chart to install New Relic Agent Control on Kubernetes

# Helm installation

This chart is not intended to be installed on its own. Instead, it is designed to be installed as part of the [agent-control](https://github.com/newrelic/helm-charts/tree/master/charts/agent-control) chart.

## Values managed globally

This chart implements the [New Relic's common Helm library](https://github.com/newrelic/helm-charts/tree/master/library/common-library) which
means that it honors a wide range of defaults and globals common to most New Relic Helm charts.

Options that can be defined globally include `affinity`, `nodeSelector`, `tolerations`, `proxy` and others. The full list can be found at
[user's guide of the common library](https://github.com/newrelic/helm-charts/blob/master/library/common-library/README.md).

## Values

|-----|------|---------|-------------|
| affinity | object | `{}` | Sets pod/node affinities. Can be configured also with `global.affinity` |
| cluster | string | `""` | Name of the Kubernetes cluster monitored. Can be configured also with `global.cluster`. |
| config.agentControl | object | See `values.yaml` | Configuration for the Agent Control. |
| config.agentControl.content | object | `{}` | Overrides the configuration that has been created automatically by the chart. This configuration here will be **MERGED** with the configuration specified above. If you need to have you own configuration, disabled the creation of this configMap and create your own. |

| config.fleet_control.auth.secret.client_id.base64 | string | `nil` | In case `.config.auth.secret.create` is true, you can set these keys to set client ID directly as base64 if you want to skip its creation. This options is mutually exclusive with `plain`. |
| config.fleet_control.auth.secret.client_id.plain | string | `nil` | In case `.config.auth.secret.create` is true, you can set these keys to set client ID directly as plain text if you want to skip its creation. This options is mutually exclusive with `base64`. |

| config.fleet_control.auth.secret.create | bool | `true` |  |
| config.fleet_control.auth.secret.name | string | release name suffixed with "-auth" | Name auth' secret provided by the user. If the creation of this secret is set to `true`, this is the same the secret will have. |
| config.fleet_control.auth.secret.private_key.base64_pem | string | `nil` | In case `.config.auth.secret.create` is true, you can set these keys to set private key directly as base64 if you want to skip its creation. This options is mutually exclusive with `plain_pem`. |
| config.fleet_control.auth.secret.private_key.plain_pem | string | `nil` | In case `.config.auth.secret.create` is true, you can set these keys to set private key directly as plain text if you want to skip its creation. This options is mutually exclusive with `base64_pem`. |
| config.fleet_control.auth.secret.private_key.secret_key | string | `private_key` | Key inside the secret containing the private key. |
| config.fleet_control.enabled | bool | `true` | Enables or disables the auth against fleet control. It implies to disable any fleet communication and running the agent in stand alone mode where only the agents specified on `.config.subAgents` will be launched. |
