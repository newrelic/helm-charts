# scrape_services Allows to enable scraping the service and not the endpoints behind.
# When endpoints are scraped this is no longer needed

# To better support visualization of this data, percentiles are calculated
# based on the histogram metrics and sent to New Relic.
# By default, the following percentiles are calculated: 50, 95 and 99.
