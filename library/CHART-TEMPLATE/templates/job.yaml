# It is common in our charts to have jobs that are using images out of docker.io registry that
# are responsible of creating certificates and inject them to api services and mutating webhooks

# To do not have colliding name, jobs are usually prefixed and the images we use to patch the webhooks
# are not in our registry but in k8s.gcr.io.

# This is why we test truncateToDNSWithSuffix and images.image with "defaultRegistry" here.

# This helper is normally used simply as this
# name: {{ include "newrelic.common.naming.truncateToDNSWithSuffix" ( dict "name" (include "newrelic.common.naming.fullname" .) "suffix" "job-suffix" ) }}
# But we add `(.Values.jobSuffix | default "job-suffix")` to be able to test short and long suffixes in the test suite.
