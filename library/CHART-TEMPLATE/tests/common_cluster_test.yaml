suite: test cluster helper
templates:
  - templates/deployment.yaml
release:
  name: my-release
  namespace: my-namespace

# The name of the cluster is mandatory, to not make all the tests fail because they have no license
# and not having to add license to all the tests I have added it to the `values.yaml`.
# This change makes this tests a bit funky because we have to manually set local cluster to null
#constantly to overwrite it.

tests:
  - it: helper works when global is null
    set:
      global: null
      cluster: test-cluster
    asserts:
      - equal:
          path: spec.template.spec.containers[0].env[0].value
          value: test-cluster

  - it: helper works when local is null
    set:
      global:
        cluster: test-cluster
      cluster: null
    asserts:
      - equal:
          path: spec.template.spec.containers[0].env[0].value
          value: test-cluster

#I found no way of asserting failing configurations. This test fails with:
# Error: execution error at (CHART-TEMPLATE/templates/deployment.yaml:71:24): There is not cluster name definition set neither in `.global.cluster' nor `.cluster' in your values.yaml. Cluster name is required.
#  - it: helper works (and fails) when cluster is null everywhere
#    set:
#      global: null
#      cluster: test
#    asserts:
#      - hasDocuments:
#          count: 0

  - it: sets local cluster as cluster name even if global is set
    set:
      cluster: test-cluster
      global:
        cluster: global-cluster
    asserts:
      - equal:
          path: spec.template.spec.containers[0].env[0].value
          value: test-cluster

  - it: sets global cluster as name if only global is set
    set:
      global:
        cluster: global-cluster
      cluster: null
    asserts:
      - equal:
          path: spec.template.spec.containers[0].env[0].value
          value: global-cluster
