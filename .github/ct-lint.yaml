# In this repository there are two folder with charts that need to be released. One can think that it would be easier to  simply at to this file
# a chart-dirs clause pointing to both of the folders at the same time:

# ```yaml
# chart-dirs:
#   - library
#   - charts
# ```

# In that case `ct install` is going to try to install the library chart and is going to fail. That is the reason there are two `ct.yaml` files, one
# for the step that lint that includes all the folders at the same time and other of the installation step that test installability

chart-dirs:
  - library
  - charts
