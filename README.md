## <a name='Prerequisites'></a>Prerequisites

* Helm CLI ([install instructions][installing-helm])
* New Relic account

## <a name='Installthecharts'></a>Install
You can have all the information about the installation in the [New Relic Documentation page for installaing the Kubernetes integration
using Helm](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/kubernetes-pixie/kubernetes-integration/installation/install-kubernetes-integration-using-helm/)

Just as a glance of the process of installation and configuration the process involves to create a `values.yaml` that will look like this:
```yaml
global:
  licenseKey: YOUR_LICENSE_KEY
  cluster: YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME
nri-kube-events:
  enabled: true
nri-metadata-injection:
  enabled: true
nri-prometheus:
  enabled: true
newrelic-logging:
  enabled: true
kube-state-metrics:
  enabled: true
```

Add the official repository:
```sh
helm repo add newrelic https://helm-charts.newrelic.com
```

Then, run `helm upgrade`:
```shell
helm upgrade --install newrelic-bundle newrelic/nri-bundle -f your-custom-values.yaml
```

You can find a list of all the global values in the [`nri-bundle`'s README](charts/nri-bundle/README.md). There you can find also links
to the values of all the subcharts.

### <a name='Examples'></a>Examples

The following example installs the `nri-bundle` chart, which groups multiple New Relic charts into one. `nri-bundle` contains:

- [New Relic's Kubernetes integration][newrelic-kubernetes]
- [New Relic's Kubernetes plugin for logs][newrelic-logs]
- [New Relic's Prometheus OpenMetrics integration][newrelic-prometheus]
- [Metadata injection webhook][newrelic-webhook]
- [Kube state metrics][ksm]

### <a name='Upgrading'></a>Upgrading to the new version of KSM
You can find additional information on how to upgrade to the new version of KSM in the [New Relic Documentation page for Kubernetes Compatibility and Requirements](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/kubernetes-pixie/kubernetes-integration/get-started/kubernetes-integration-compatibility-requirements/#upgrading-to-the-new-version-of-ksm)

## <a name='Development'></a>Development

You can use the [Helm CLI][installing-helm] to develop a chart and add it to this repository.

1. Clone this repository on your local machine.
2. Add or modify the files for the desired chart.
3. To install the chart locally, run `helm install dev-chart charts/<YOUR_CHART>`
4. Verify that the chart works as expected.
5. Remove the installed chart with `helm uninstall dev-chart`.
6. Create your pull request and follow the instructions below.

> Feel free to add different values to the chart.

### <a name='Automatedversionbumps'></a>Automated version bumps

This repository uses [Renovate](https://docs.renovatebot.com/configuration-options/) to automatically bump dependencies. It currently supports updating dependencies on `nri-bundle` whenever an individual chart gets released.

Unfortunately, renovate does not support yet updating `appVersion`, nor [`image.tag` entries in `values.yaml`](https://github.com/renovatebot/renovate/issues/4728).
